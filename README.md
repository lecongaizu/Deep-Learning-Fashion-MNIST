In this project, I used to a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras on the Fashion MNIST dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset is meant to be a (slightly more challenging) drop-in replacement for the (less challenging) MNIST dataset
Similar to the MNIST digit dataset, the Fashion MNIST dataset includes:
  •	60,000 training examples
  •	10,000 testing examples
  •	10 classes
  •	28×28 grayscale/single channel images
Before running this project, we need to install some libraries as follows:
1.	Install Keras framework:
  Installing Keras is a breeze — pip  can do all the hard work for us. First, we need to install a few dependencies:
    $ pip install numpy scipy
    $ pip install scikit-learn
    $ pip install pillow
    $ pip install h5py
  We also need to install Tensorflow. You can certainly use pip  to install TensorFlow:
    $ pip install tensorflow
  GPU users that have already installed CUDA and cuDNN can install the GPU version of 
    $ pip install tensorflow-gpu
  From there, we can use pip  to install Keras as well:
    $ pip install keras

2. Install OpenCv from 3.3.0 with Keras framework.

How to run this project.
After install all libraries, go to the folder,
python3 fashion_mnist.py
